        <div class="reflection__left">
          <p>
            <div><strong>Context, Audience and Purpose</strong></div> My assignment was to write and then present to class,
            a comparison and contrast of two chapters out of JoAnn Hackos’ book, <em>Information Development</em>. When I
            first started reading chapter two, I realized it was long and detailed. I considered changing to a shorter
            chapter. However, as I pushed myself to continue reading, I marveled how she was able to navigate complicated
            processes in such an understandable manner. Indeed, it was long, but far from boring. I learned from writing and
            editing the essay, and also about the extensive and problematic issues that IT managers face, and I saw example
            after example of well-constructed, flowing sentences. This was undoubtably one of my favorite essays in the MATC
            program.</p>
    
            <p>
            <div><strong>Design Process</strong></div>I read through every detail of both chapters, as thoroughly as
            possible. I then wrote a detailed summary of each of them. Then I tied them together, writing the similarities
            and differences. Both of the chapters focused on how to introduce incremental changes, and then measure the
            results. Then determine if the changes positively or negatively effect growth. In the midst of all this, keep
            taking into account the needs of the customer. </p>
    
            <p>
            <div><strong>Strengths</strong></div>The methods that Hackos explains demonstrates workable an in-depth
            understanding of the IT industry, management, technical communication and the customer. It is well-written,
            relevant, usable, and current. It has one main focus and it doesn’t pull in any secondary arguments to
            complicate it. The format looks professional and meets the needs of readability for the audience with
            sophisticated command of English. </p>
    
            <p>
            <div><strong>Weaknesses</strong></div> Looking back I see I should have asked the instructor for clarification.
            I realize now that there are a few ideas that could be juxtaposed. I chose at that time, the option of writing
            an introduction, then a summary of each chapter as the body of essay, then a conclusion. Other options for
            compare/contrast could be how Hackos presented the information, like the typeface, grouping of information, font
            color, design, and presentation; although that approach wasn't relevent to chapters of the same book. A third
            option, that I didn't think of then, would be the differences in the application of the two management styles.
            When and where each one would be most effective. Possible barriers, ideal circumstances for each. That would
            have taken more time and research. Possibly that level of depth of was be beyond the scope of the class. Maybe
            that would be a topic for a business class.</p>
    
            <p>A comparison/contrast essay would most likely only be used in the context of a classroom assignment. If a
              summary of the information was to be dissseminated, a more efficacious route might be a well-designed power
              point presentation with relevant graphics.</p>
    
            <p>
            <div><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></div>JoAnn Hackos evaluation process of IT management could easily be
            applied to other situations. Writing about it reinforced the concepts I read.</p>

            <h2 class="hackos__art_title"><strong>Chapters 2 & 8: A Comparison</strong></h2>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Introduction</strong></div>Hackos’ underpins her arguments with example after example of
            managerial choices that impeded growth, as well as options that have a proven higher success rate.
            Chapter 2 and 8 both explain critical components that must be in place for an organization to be successful,
            but the high level of detail invovled in completing the IPMM, make it more suitable for large organizations.
            Smaller organizations might opt for the less detailed, but still extemely efective <em></em>Six
            Sigma</em>Both chapters offer guidelines and steps which, if an organization chooses to take them, they can
            propel themselves into stronger leadership and a higher level of maturity, ultimately leading to higher
            profitability. The differences are that chapter 2 is an outsider’s perspective, looking in to identify the
            problems and offer methods to correct them. Chapter 8, on the other hand, is a managerial guide on how to
            proceed.</p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Chapter 2</strong></div>
            Chapter 2 describes the criteria and the reasons for the criteria that make up the IPMM assessment. It
            explains that the assessment results determine an organization’s maturity level. The process begins with the
            staff members filling out questionaries. The IPMM assessors review the questionnaire responses and then
            interview the staff. After that the assessors analyze the data and then rate their maturity level. If the
            organization receives a low rating, the staff is then guided on how to adjust their organizational structure
            and priorities. If the staff are compliant, they can begin to move toward maturity. Only companies that
            score high on the IPMM can obtain government contracts.</p>
            <p>The assessment is multifaceted with a strong emphasis on four interrelated key characteristics: a
              centralized organizational structure, self-actualized collaboration, information design, and quality
              management. Both a centralized organizational structure and self-actualized collaboration fall in the
              category of process management. Information design and quality management both facilitate examining of the
              effectiveness of the organization in serving the needs of customers.
              The remaining criteria are quality assurance, early planning, estimating and scheduling, hiring and
              training, and cost control. How all of these remaining processes are carried out is directly influenced by
              whether or not the organizational structure is centralized and how strong the collaborative mindset is.
              The priorities of these remaining processes are determined by the strength in the organization’s vision to
              meet the customer’s needs.</p>
            <p>If an organization receives a low score, and wishes to strive for maturity, they must revamp their
              leadership style. They must create a centralized organizational structure and management that is engaged
              with the staff. They must build an environment that welcomes collaboration. Effective collaboration paves
              the way to more precision development of more uniform standards of quality. Hackos writes, “Collaborating
              is complicated. Staff need to work together, and agree upon standards for writing style, information
              typing, structured writing, and audience definition, in addition to basic processes for information
              planning, estimating, scheduling, and tracking. Collaboration seems to be mostly a state of mind, an
              ability to work with others toward a common goal, and to abandon an ego-driven attachment to one’s own
              control over everything” (69). </p>
            <p>Prioritizing is key. An organizations priority is must be the needs of the customer. This will take shape
              in information design and quality management. A serious information design department encourages its staff
              to continuously contribute innovative ideas. This gives the staff a personal incentive to consider
              customer needs. </p>
            <p>Cutting edge innovation requires a constant measurement of how well the customer adapts to the new
              design. Well-developed quality management equates to a cautious evaluation of the customer’s needs through
              studies and research. Hackos writes, “When I interview users of exemplary information design, they tell me
              that they were able to get started quickly, find the answers to their questions easily and achieve their
              goals with great ease. Customers with great information on hand use the products and services they buy
              from you with ease.”</p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Chapter 8</strong></div>
            On the other hand, chapter eight describes a method that managers can use to improve staff performance and
            increase company productivity. Hackos talks about how organizations can mistakenly attempt to increase
            efficiency by more closely monitoring quantifiable processes. A more effective plan is a more abstract
            approach. It involves understanding how to measure “only what you need to measure to ensure that you are
            meeting your goals (183).” This method closely follows a successful management plan called Six Sigma.</p>
            <p>Six Sigma was developed by Motorola. It involves setting productivity goals. Then you “make small,
              incremental changes...As each small change is implemented, you measure the success of the change and
              decide if you are going in the right direction. If the results are negative or not as robust as you had
              expected, you can use the incremental change process to adjust the implementation or pursue another course
              (184).” </p>
            <p>Chapter 8 goes through each step of the change process with a subheading and an explanation for each of
              the six segments in the Six Sigma process.</p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Six steps:</strong></div>
            <ol>
              <li>Define your goals</li>
              <li>Analyze your processes</li>
              <li>Investigate the industry best practices</li>
              <li>Develop methods for measuring efficiency and effectiveness</li>
              <li>Improve processes and measure results</li>
              <li>Techniques for measuring effectiveness</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>Both chapters 2 and 8 are decidedly focused on how to improve
            management decisions. Chapter 2 has a wide scope of objectives, a list of areas to be addressed, and
            explains how all the departments in an organization are interrelated and that management choices impact the
            operation of the business. A section in chapter 2 briefly covers measuring success for information design
            innovations and quality management customer and competitor studies. Chapter 8 has a much smaller scope. It
            specifically focuses on a highly recommended decision-making process that has indeed proved to be
            successful. It outlines how to decide the best goals to set. Then, how to make a change in pursuit of the
            goal. Then, measure the results of that change. Both chapters role-model superior writing and valuable
            insight I can carry with me into the workplace.</p>
