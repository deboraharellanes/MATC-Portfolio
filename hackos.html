        <div class="reflection__left">
          <p>
            <div><strong>Context,&nbsp;Audience, and Purpose</strong></div> In ENGL 519,<em>Technical Publications Management,</em>
            my professor assigned a comparison/contrast essay of two chapters out of JoAnn Hackos’ book, <em>Information Development</em>.
            The assignment was to write the essay and then present it to class. I can speculate that his purpose for this assignment was to expose the
            students to professionally written technical communication and publication management. When I first started reading chapter two, I realized
            it was long and detailed. I considered changing to a shorter chapter. However, as I pushed myself to continue reading, I began to
            marvel at Hackos' ability to make a technical subject easy to follow. Indeed, it was long, but far from boring.
            Hackos' prose provided example after example of well-constructed, flowing sentences about the problematic issues in IT management. Working
            through this essay generated enthusiasm for learning more in the MATC program.</p>
    
            <p><div><strong>Design Process</strong></div>I read through every detail of both chapters, as thoroughly as possible.
            I then wrote a detailed summary of each. They both focused on the positive aspects of a management style that introduce
            incremental changes, measures the results, and determines if it had a positive effect. Amid all this, the needs of the
            customer are still the highest priority. After summarizing the two chapters, I then tied together how they were similar. Then I
            outlined the differences in approachs, which mostly were dependant on the size, vision, and goals of the organization.</p>
            
            <p><div><strong>Strengths</strong></div>Hackos' layout shows an in-depth understanding of technical communication,
            the IT industry, management, and integrating customer needs. It is well-written, relevant, usable, and current. The format is
            professional and the chapters cover IT management in a streamlined and comprehensible manner.</p>
    
            <p><div><strong>Weaknesses</strong></div>Looking back I see I could have asked the instructor for clarification.
            I realize now that there are a few ideas that could be juxtaposed. I chose the option of writing an introduction, then a summary
            of each chapter as the body, then a conclusion. Other options for a comparison/contrast essay could be how Hackos formatted
            the information, like the overlay, typeface and color, grouping of information, design, and presentation; although that approach
            doesn't apply to chapters of the same book (Topic for a design class). A third option, that I didn't think of then, would be the
            differences in the application of the two management styles. When and where each one would be most effective, possible barriers,
            and ideal circumstances. That would have taken more time and research. Perhaps that too was beyond the scope of the class (Topic
            for a business class).</p>
    
            <p>A comparison/contrast essay would most likely only be used in the context of a classroom assignment. If a summary of Hackos',
            <em>Information Development</em> management styles were to be disseminated, a more effective route might be a well-designed PowerPoint
            presentation with relevant graphics.</p>
    
            <p><div><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></div>JoAnn Hackos' evaluation process of IT management could apply to other work and
            life situations. Writing about it reinforced the concepts I read. Structuring a comparison/contrast can also be a useful tool for
            beginning research. When I wrote about alternative energy, I did a comparison/contrast of solar, wind, ocean waves, and
            biofuels to help me organize and decide what I needed to include.</p>

            <h2 class="hackos__art_title"><strong>Chapters 2 & 8: A Comparison</strong></h2>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Introduction</strong></div>Hackos’ underpins her arguments with example after example of
              managerial choices that impeded growth, as well as options that have a proven higher success rate.
              Chapter 2 and 8 both explain critical components that must be in place for an organization to be successful,
              but the high level of detail invovled in completing the IPMM, make it more suitable for large organizations.
              Smaller organizations might opt for the less detailed, but still extemely effective <em></em>Six
              Sigma.</em>Both chapters offer guidelines and steps which, if an organization chooses to take them, they can
              propel themselves into stronger leadership and a higher level of maturity, ultimately leading to higher
              profitability. The differences are that chapter 2 is an outsider’s perspective, looking in to identify the
              problems and offer methods to correct them. Chapter 8, on the other hand, is a managerial guide on how to
              proceed.</p>
            <p><div><strong>Chapter 2</strong></div>
              Chapter 2 is about the Information Process Maturity Model (IPMM). Hackos describes the criteria and the reasons for it. She
              explains that the results of the assessment determine an organization’s maturity level. The process begins with the
              staff members filling out questionaries. The IPMM assessors review the questionnaire responses and then
              interview the staff. After that the data is analyzed and then their maturity level is rated. If the
              organization receives a low rating, the staff is then mentored on how to adjust their structure
              and priorities. If the staff are compliant, they can begin to move toward maturity.  An organization must
              score high on the IPMM to obtain a government contract.</p>
            <p>The assessment is multifaceted, emphasizing four overlapping characteristics: a
              centralized organizational structure, self-actualized collaboration, information design, and quality
              management. Both a centralized organizational structure and self-actualized collaboration fall in the
              category of process management. Information design and quality management both facilitate examining the
              effectiveness of the organization in serving the needs of customers. The remaining criteria are quality
              assurance, early planning, estimating and scheduling, hiring and training, and cost control. How all of
              these remaining processes are carried out is directly influenced by whether or not the organizational
              structure is centralized and how strong the collaborative mindset is. The priorities of these remaining
              processes are determined by the strength in the organization’s vision to meet the customer’s needs.</p>
            <p>When organizations receives a low score, and want to raise it, they must revamp their
              leadership style. They must create a centralized organizational structure and ensure management is engaged
              with staff. They must build an environment that welcomes collaboration. Effective collaboration enables
              more precision development of uniform standards of quality. Hackos writes, “Collaborating is complicated.
              Staff need to work together, and agree upon standards for writing style, information typing, structured writing,
              and audience definition, in addition to basic processes for information planning, estimating, scheduling,
              and tracking. Collaboration seems to be mostly a state of mind, an ability to work with others toward a
              common goal, and to abandon an ego-driven attachment to one’s own control over everything” (69).
            </p>
            <p>Prioritizing is key. An organization's priority is must be the needs of the customer. This will take shape
              in information design and quality management. A serious information design department encourages its staff
              to continuously contribute innovative ideas. This gives the staff a personal incentive to consider
              customer needs. </p>
            <p>Cutting edge innovation requires a constant measurement of how well the customer adapts to the new
              design. Well-developed quality management equates to a cautious evaluation of the customer’s needs through
              studies and research. Hackos writes, “When I interview users of exemplary information design, they tell me
              that they were able to get started quickly, find the answers to their questions easily and achieve their
              goals with great ease. Customers with great information on hand use the products and services they buy
              from you with ease.”</p>
            <p><div><strong>Chapter 8</strong></div>
              On the other hand, chapter eight describes a method that managers can use to improve staff performance and
              increase company productivity. Hackos talks about how organizations can mistakenly attempt to increase
              efficiency by more closely monitoring quantifiable processes. A more effective plan is a more abstract
              approach. It involves understanding how to measure “only what you need to measure to ensure that you are
              meeting your goals (183).” This method closely follows a successful management plan called Six Sigma.</p>
            <p>Six Sigma was developed by Motorola. It involves setting productivity goals. Then you “make small,
              incremental changes...As each small change is implemented, you measure the success of the change and
              decide if you are going in the right direction. If the results are negative or not as robust as you had
              expected, you can use the incremental change process to adjust the implementation or pursue another course
              (184).” </p>
            <p>Chapter 8 goes through each step of the change process with a subheading and an explanation for each of
              the six processes.</p>
            <p>
            <div><strong>Six steps:</strong></div>
            <ol>
              <li>Define your goals</li>
              <li>Analyze your processes</li>
              <li>Investigate the industry best practices</li>
              <li>Develop methods for measuring efficiency and effectiveness</li>
              <li>Improve processes and measure results</li>
              <li>Techniques for measuring effectiveness</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p><div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>Both chapters 2 and 8 are decidedly focused on how to improve
            management decisions. Chapter 2 has a wide scope of objectives, a list of areas to be addressed, and
            explains how all the departments in an organization are interrelated and that management choices impact the
            operation of the business. A section in chapter 2 briefly covers measuring success for information design
            innovations and quality management customer and competitor studies. Chapter 8 has a much smaller scope. It
            specifically focuses on a highly recommended decision-making process that has indeed proved to be
            successful. It outlines how to decide the best goals to set. Then, how to make a change in pursuit of the
            goal. Then, measure the results of that change. Both chapters role-model superior writing and valuable
            insight I can carry with me into the workplace.</p>
