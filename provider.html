        <div><strong>Context, Audience and Purpose</strong></div>
        Provider Farms sell raw goat and cow milk, grass-fed meat, and other farm products that they make. They are
        based in Mountain Home. They fill their van with their products and drive to their pick-up sites, which are
        parking lots of businesses. They have a website for information and ordering, and business cards, but other than
        that they find customers through word of mouth. They need a brochure to hand out or hang on bulletin boards. My
        purpose is to attract customers and interest them in wanting to buy the products. Their prices are higher than
        the local grocery stores. My audience is quite open; any person willing to read the brochure is a potential
        customer. Although, the majority of people who would be willing to go out of thier way to buy farm fresh
        products would tend be those interested in health and nutrition.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Design Process</strong></div>
        I created this version of the brochure with Visme. The brick red color and the borders alignment repeat through
        the brochure and contrast against the white background and black text. The different groups of information, like
        contact, about the cows, the glass jar exchange, and pick-up information are placed, topic-by-topic all with
        relevent proximity. I used two images redolent of farm life, an old-fashioned <em>milk & cream</em> image (late
        1800s) and a young girl milking a cow. All the text is sans serif and in left alignment, with the exception of
        the title <em>Raw Cow and Goat Milk</em> which is centered.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Strengths</strong></div>
        The brick red color of the border contrast well against the white background, the Provider Farms logo, and the
        old style milk graphic. The over-all look is warm and friendly and easily digestible. The information is
        up-to-date, and the brochure is organized and uncluttered. I used large print san serif for readability. The
        brochure includes all of the necessary information for a customer to get started right away ordering and
        picking-up products.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Weakness</strong></div>
        This is a trifold, and would not work as on on-line document.The first time I designed this tri-fold I used
        InDesign software, which is an app within the paid Adobe subscription, so a subscription is needed to update it. 
         Which increases the chance of it never being updated and reused. One option that I haven't explored is Scribus, 
        free design software that appears to have a lot of flexibility. Also InDesign's save options are ID or PDF. 
        JPG isn't a choice. Because of these limitations, I recreated the brochure using VISME Design software. VISME has
        a free limited usage account and saves in almost every format possible.</p><p>However, InDesign colors are more 
        defined and vibrant. I downloaded a beautiful icon, but I couldn't match it up with Visme's color palette, so I didn't
        use it. When I resized the farm's family photo to less pixels, it became blurry on VISME, so I couldn't use it. I ended 
        up googling <em>farm images</em> and found a suitable image, but their family photo gives a lot more rhetorical 
        information. Also VISME's text boxes only handle small amounts of text. At first I used a typeface suggestive of
        an old-style, but it came out blurry. I switched to a helvetica equivalent sans serif and increased the size for
        better readabiliy. With all these negatives, I still think it would be usable.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></div>
        I was able to develop collaborative skills by interacting with clients and learning their story. I experimented
        with InDesign and Visme and integrated the design principles and rhetoric.</p>
