        <div><strong>Context,&nbsp;Audience, and Purpose</strong></div>
        Provider Farms sells raw goat and cow milk, grass-fed meat, and other products that they make on their Mountain
        Home based farm. At their pick-up sites, which are usually parking lots, they sell products (mostly milk and eggs)
        stored in coolersout of thier van. They have a website for information and ordering,
        and business cards, but other than that they find customers through word of mouth. They need a brochure to hand
        out or hang on bulletin boards. My purpose is to attract customers and interest them in wanting to buy the products.
        My audience is quite open; any person willing to read the brochure is a potential customer. Although, the majority
        of people who would be willing to go out of their way to buy farm-fresh products would tend to be those interested
        in health and nutrition. Their prices are higher than the local grocery stores.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Design Process</strong></div>
        I created this version of the brochure with Visme. The brick red color matches the farms logo and the alignment
        of the borders repeat through the brochure and contrast against the white background and black text. The different
        groups of information, like contact, about the cows, the glass jar exchange, and pick-up information are placed,
        topic-by-topic all with relevant proximity. For headings and subheadings I used a informal sans serif with a
        significantly larger font size. The body text is all in a formal sans serif in 12pt. I used the informal and
        formal font pairing to persuade the audience that the business environment is informal, yet legitimate. The
        font pairing also creates contrast making the heading and text easily distinguishable. I used two images redolent
        of farm life, an old-fashioned <em>milk & cream</em> image (the late 1800s) and a young girl milking a cow.
        I used vintage images to represent the with the vision of organization, a farm selling products the old-fashioned
        way. All the text is left aligned, except the title <em>Raw Cow and Goat Milk</em> is centered.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Strengths</strong></div>
        The brick red color of the border contrast well against the white background, the Provider Farms logo, and the
        old-style milk graphic. The overall look is warm and friendly and easily digestible. The information is up-to-date,
        and the brochure is organized and uncluttered. I used large print san serif for readability. The brochure includes
        all of the necessary information for a customer to get started right away ordering and picking up products.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Weakness</strong></div>
        This is a trifold, meant to be folded in thirds, so it would not work as an online document. The first time, 
        I designed it with InDesign software, an app in my paid subscription to Adobe. I realized that the same subscription
        is needed to update the brochure, which probably means there is a high chance it will never be reused. One option
        that I haven't explored is Scribus design software that is free and appears to have a lot of flexibility. Also, InDesign's
        save options are ID(InDesign) or PDF, but not JPG or PNG. Linking images on a website requires a JPG or PNG. Because
        of these limitations, I recreated the brochure using VISME Design software because it has a free limited-use account
        with a JPG option.</p> <p>However, InDesign colors are more defined and vibrant. I downloaded a beautiful icon, but I couldn't
        match it up with Visme's color palette, so I didn't use it. When I resized the family photo of the farmers, it became blurry
        on VISME, so I couldn't use it. I ended up googling <em>farm images</em> and found a suitable image, but their family photo
        conveys a lot more rhetorical information. VISME's text boxes only handle small amounts of text. At first, I used an informal
        typeface, suggestive of farm life. It looked nice on the original, but after I downloaded as a JPG and then resized, saved,
        and uploaded, it lost image quality and was unusable. I switched to a Helvetica equivalent sans serif and increased the size
        for better readability, but that had less rhetorical influence. With all these negatives, I still think the brochure is usable.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></div>
        I was able to develop collaborative skills by interacting with clients and learning their story. The owner of the farm, (also the
        head of household and father to the nine kids), told me about how he grew up on a farm and has always raised cattle, and how they
        ended up in Mountain Home. Learning his story made the rhetorical situation more understandable, which was gave me clarity on How
        to make design choices. I experimented with InDesign and Visme and integrated rhetoric with design principles.</p>
