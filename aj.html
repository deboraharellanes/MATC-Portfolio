        <div><strong>Context, Audience and Purpose</strong></div>
        AJ lives in Lancaster California and works as an electrical engineer. He has been running an
        evening/weekends home remodeling business out of his house. All his customers are by word of mouth. No business
        cards, brochures, or a website. My internship assignment was to design a website for him to help him attract new
        customers. He provided me with the basic information of photos of his past work and the list of jobs he is able
        to do. The purpose of the website is to showcase his work and provide a way for new customers to find him. My
        audience is anyone in his area of southern California who would like their home remodeled.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Design Process</strong></div>
        I created the logo <e>AJ Remodels</e>  using Canva design software. I used a graphic of a tan paint slab of paint in a brush
        stroke with black text for good contrast. For repetition, The logo in the left corner and repeated in center
        alignment in the footer. The color scheme is tan and brown and I used light to dark, 90 degree, linear gradients
        in the background, header, and footer creating contrast and repetition. Black text contrasts against the
        background. The navigation bar and bulleted list of skills is left aligned creating reptition. On the second
        page I created a table for the photos which takes up the entire page. The last page has all the same repetitive
        elements with a centered email submission box.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Strengths</strong></div>
        It is strait forward, in large readable sans-serif text with relevent information, listing job skills and photos
        of past work and an email submission form. No clutter and extra stuff to drowned out the main points and
        distract.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Weaknesses</strong></div>
        So far it is a three-page website. It doesnâ€™t have all the content most web sites have and or the interactive
        capabities that websites have. It is an on-going project, and I will be adding more information as the client
        provides it. I am working towards learning more web design so that I can implement them.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></div>
        I learned Canva and reviewed HTML and CSS. I tried out different colors, text placements, graphics, and
        alignments. Working on this website forced me to think through how placement effects user experience.</p>
