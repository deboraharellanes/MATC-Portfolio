<p><div><strong>Context,&nbsp;Audience, and Purpose</strong>
</div>My purpose for designing a solar energy infographic is to to raise awareness and I designed it to be easily skimmed.
My audience is those who have heard about renewable energy but havenâ€™t invested any time in learning about it. It is
introductory, providing a general explanation of a hugely complex issue. After decades of research, solar energy is only
starting to gain popularity and there is no shortage of barriers.</p>
 
<p><div><strong>Design Process</strong></div>
From beginning to end, I mapped out each element using contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity.
I contrasted brown against a white background and repeated that color scheme in center alignment throughout.
White text in the title bar contrasts against the brown background, with the sun graphic beginning the center
alignment. Under that, a horizontal brown bar creates reptition and a centered globe reinforces the alignment.
Directly under that I centered a recyling icon, and then a brown horizontal bar for repetition, and then a
center-aligned solar panel graphic.</p>
<p>The words <em>Pros</em> and <em>Cons</em> repeat color and font style, and are backed against the left
and right margins to reinforce center alignment.Transitioning to the list, brown slabs are repeated, contrasting
against the white text. In close proximity, the black text contrasts against the white background. The brown
center-aligned vertical margin contrasts against the white backdrop and continues repetition.</p> <p>I learned that
multi-colored graphics can be more effective when their design scheme contrasts well with the background. So I
placed the white top-right to meet the bottom of the brown center-aligned bar, above the footer. This continues
center alignment, contrast, and repetition. The footer is a slab of brown with contrasting white text. The brown
overlay creates proximity and alignment with color and graphics. The chunk of white space at the top and then all
the text placed in the bottom three/fourths creates proximity.</p> 

<p><div><strong>Strengths</strong></div>
Effective design elements make the infographic vibrant. Large print ensures ease of reading. The information
is relevant, up-to-date, and important to understand. I included every pro and con that I could find out and a
blurb that is as acurate and informative as possible. A reader with a vague prior background can easily digest
the overall message.</p>

<p><div><strong>Weaknesses</strong></div>
I created the infographic using VISME Design software, which has templates, fonts, and graphics to design almost any
kind of media.&nbsp;When I clicked <em>infographic</em> I was routed to a plethora of templates and an option for a
blank page. The only size option for an infographic is long and narrow and horizontal information did not fit well.
The small print was unreadable, and decorative fonts were blurry, so I had to use a Visme font called <em>Lato</em>,
a Helvetica equivalent, which I would not have if I had other options. Such large print on the narrow page gives it a
cluttered look.</p> <p> The pros and cons list is abridged, only hitting the high points of enormous complexities.
Each pro and con already has numerous books written, and many are outdated because of rapid technological
advancement.</p>

<p><div><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></div>
VISME design software provided loads of templates that I experimented with to help me decide on the most professional look.
I tried out different colors, texts, graphics, and alignments. I thought through what kind of information is really important
and which placement will be most effective.</p>
