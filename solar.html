<p><div><strong>Context, Audience, and Purpose</strong></div>I designed my solar energy infographic to be easily skimmed. After decades upon decades of research, solar energy is only starting to gain popularity. There are still a lot of opponents and barriers. My purpose is to make available a summary of the pros and cons, to raise awareness.  My audience is those who have heard about renewable energy but havenâ€™t invested any time in learning about it. It is introductory, providing a general explanation of a hugely complex issue and designed for a reader to scan it and pick up the main ideas. </p>
 
<p><div><strong>Design Process</strong></div>
 From begining to end, I mapped out each element using contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. I contrasted brown against a white backdrop, and repeated it in center alighment all the way down. The white text in the title bar contrasts against brown, with the sun graphic beginning the center alignment. Under that a horizontal brown bar creates reptition and a centered globe reinforcing the alignment. Directly under that I centered a recyling icon, and then a brown horizontal bar for repetiton and then a center aligned solar graphic. The words <em>Pros</em> and <em>Cons</em> use repetition in font style and color and are on the left and right margins to reinforce center alignment. Transitioning to the list, brown slabs are repeated, contrasting against white text. In close proximity the black text contrasts against the white background. The brown center aligned vertical margin contrasts against the white backdrop and continues repetition. I learned that multi-colored graphics can be more effective when their design scheme contrasts well with the background. So I placed the white top right to meet the bottom of the brown center aligned bar, above the footer. This continues center alignment, contrast, and reptition. The footer is a big slab of brown with contrasting white text. The brown overlay creates proximity with color and the graphics are grouped together in the center alignment. The chunk of white space at the top and then all the text placed in the bottom three/fourths creates proximity.</p> 

<p><div><strong>Strengths</strong></div>
Effective use of design elements make the infographic vibrant. Large print ensures ease of reading. The information is relevant, and up to date, and important to understand. Staying current is vital to understanding the discussions and economic, political, and infrastructural decisions.&nbsp;A reader with vague prior background can easily digest the overall message. </p>

<p><div><strong>Weaknesses</strong></div>
I created the infographic using VISME Design software, which has templates, fonts and graphics to design almost any kind of media.&nbsp; When I clicked <em>infographic</em> I was routed to a plethora of templates and an option for a blank page. The only size option for an infographic is long and narrow and horizontal information did not fit well. Small print was unreadable, so I had to use large helvitica equivalent, which I would not have used if I had other possibilities. I used a Visme font called <em>Lato</em>, because other more stylistic fonts created blurriness. Such large print on the narrow page give it a slightly cluttered look. Abridged information in a pros and cons list usually hit the high points. In this case, the pros and cons are only touching the surface of enormous complexities. Each individual pro and con already has numerous books written, and many outdated because of rapid technological advancement.</p>

<p><div><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></div>
VISME design software provided loads of templates that I experimented with to help me decide on the most professional look. I tried out different colors, texts, graphics, and alignments. I thought through what kind of information is really important and which placement will be most effective.</p>
