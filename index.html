          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>
          <div class="intro">I completed my BA double major in English/Linguistics and Social Work in 2002. Wanting to expand
            my career options, I enrolled in the  MATC (Master of Arts Technical Communication) program in 2015. Every MATC course,
            uniquely, taught me that good technical communication equates to deliverables that are easily read and understood.
            The homework has entailed, among other things, countless hours of writing and editing. Each assignment advanced my writing
            skills. I can now more quickly create effective documents because I can recognize a lack of flow, analyze user experience,
            and apply design principles. My portfolio demonstrates a wide array of topics and applications.</div>
          </p>

          <p>
          <div><strong>Academics</strong></div>
          <div class="intro">The MATC program constantly exposed to new information, pushing me to higher levels of
            understanding. One memorable experience was in my first class, 512 <em>Technical Rhetoric and Applications</em>. The
            assignment was to write a 5-page proposal and then present it on PowerPoint. I chose solar energy. At that time, I had only
            read one book about it, Danny Kennedy’s <em>Rooftop Revolution: How Solar Power can save our Economy—and Our
            Planet—from Dirty Energy</em>. This assignment gave me the chance to research the field through various books,
            websites, documentaries, and interviewing people in the field. I learned that there are a tremendous amount of
            options, as well as high-stakes obstacles to overcome, colossal benefits and drawbacks, and they affect everyone,
            and the future of the world, economically and politically—both negatively and positively. Learning about such
            a large assortment of issues and then figuring out how to include them all in one paper and PowerPoint presentation
            pushed me to think more in-depth about how to present information. I wanted an all-inclusive proposal—not missing 
            any known aspect—to ensure it would hold up in a professional setting. I spent hours combing through research, organizing,
            writing, and re-writing. I addressed each issue systematically and smoothly transitioned through topics as they
            related to each other. My completed proposal included an overview of the problems with fossil fuels and an in-depth
            explanation of a home solar system. My PowerPoint presentation detailed the hazards of fossil fuels and the barriers to
            solar and wind energy.</div>
          </p>
          <p>
          <div class="intro">My second class was 518 <em>Writing Software Documentation</em>. I was first introduced to HTML
            about 10 years ago but didn't continue learning it. In 518, I was reintroduced to it and coded
            my first multi page website about how to repair VWs. I didn't have a strong mechanical background but gained
            collaborative experience working with a mechanic and then organized, wrote, and edited, while incorporating
            user experience and design principles. For my internship, I coded a website for an electrical engineer
            who runs a small home remodeling business on weekends. He needed a website for potential customers to find him,
            as well as to recruit employees.</div>
          </p>
          <p>
          <div class="intro">For me, the backbone of the MATC program was 513 <em>Technical Editing</em>. Although I
            didn’t take it until my 4th semester, I wonder if it would have made my previous semesters easier because I
            learned so much about the intricacies of writing. Every day we were editing. Some were poorly written sentences
            with an easy fix. Others were full of big words that had to be condensed down to plain language. I learned about
            stress and emphasis, word placement, new and old info, eliminating redundancies, using words that 
            give life to writing, and deleting words and phrases that create vagueness. The extensive level of
            editing made my future classes and the entire writing process easier. Although, no matter how much I edit,
            every time I reread my writing, I wonder how I could have ever thought it flowed in the first place.</div>
          </p>
          <p>
          <div class="intro">In 511 <em>Rhetorical Theory for Workplace Writers</em>, we read journal articles every
            week. I began looking at writing from the perspective of analyzing how the author organized the information.
            On one assignment, I was stuck in writers-block-mode and struggling with the concluding paragraph. So, I
            put it down and went to skim another journal article. As I began reading through it, I came to a sentence that 
            read “…every typeface has rhetoric…,” (along with a lengthy discussion). There it was! <em>Bam!</em>&mdash;the
            <em>aha</em> moment! I expanded on that concept for that pesky conclusion I was stuck on, and appropriately cited.
            That revelation clarified for me how important it is for me to learn as much as possible about writing and design
            because it would enable me to create far more valuable pieces.</div>
          </p>
          <p>
          <div class="intro">Every class required a presentation. That helped me learn to choose my words carefully. I didn't
            want to stand there and bore everybody. I learned to create effective PowerPoint presentations by spending hours
            making sure each explanation flowed well to the next and that the slides were relevant and interesting. Most notably,
            in my presentation about alternative energy, I showed photos of each of the fossil fuels and uranium in
            their perspective excavation sites, and then their potential dangers, specifically fires and meltdowns.  I then
            listed (with an accompanying photo), the unintended consequences which are, among others, smog and acid rain, and how
            air pollution particles are microscopic, easily breathed in, and can enter the bloodstream, and are highly toxic.
            I then explained how alternative energy is the solution, existing barriers, and how the scientific community is working
            to remove them.  
          </div>
          </p>
          <p>
          <div><strong>Ready to Move Forward</strong></div>
          <div class="intro">Throughout the program, I have developed a far more organized strategy for working through writing projects.
            I consider typeface, design, colors, as well as effective plain language. My highest priority is how easily the reader will
            absorb the information. I think through how and why a document will be used and what I can do to make that a
            positive experience. Thinking back to my first solar energy proposal experience in 512, I see tremendous
            growth.</div>
