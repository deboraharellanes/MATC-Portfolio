        <div><strong>Context, &nbsp;Audience, and Purpose</strong></div>
        Sometime ago, I don’t know when, my dad bought a 1970 Beetle. It changed hands a few times, till it was passed
        down to me. By then it needed a lot of work. I found a small VW repair shop—and little did I know, I was walking
        into the hub of a community of Vintage VW connoisseurs and collectors. I became friends with the owners and
        within a few years found myself immersed.<p>  <p>My idea for the website started as a tribute to all the great people that keep old VW’s running. It evolved
        into a beginner’s repair guide. My audience is mechanics who know already know how to work on cars but need
        specifics about VW’s. Or beginning mechanics needing to learn the basics.
        </p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Design Process</strong></div>
        I collaborated with a VW mechanic who works out of his garage. All the car parts in the photos belong to him,
        and the demonstration photos are him removing an engine, then disassembling it, and then installing. He explained
        to me how a 4-stroke engine works, as well as the other processes.
        &nbsp;
        It is all white background with a contrasting black menu bar with black text and graphics. I experimented with
        text colors but didn’t like how any other turned out. I used Helvetica on all the text to keep it straightforward
        and readable. I used Architects Daughter typeface in the navigation bar, to give it some variation and style. I
        used a combination of real-life photos and illustrated graphics</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Strengths</strong></div>A user can easily find information and it has an abundance of relevent
        graphics. The naviagtion bar is in large Helvetica print for easy use and readability. I coded the website in
        HTML, instead of using preformatted drag and drop software. It takes longer this way, but gives the author a lot
        more freedom with design choices and interactive functions. I am taking classes to learn them better.
        </p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Weakness</strong></div>
        My VW website is a 1990's level of sophistication. Eventhough I incorporated user experience and design concepts
        to the best of my ability, it still doesn't have any interactive capabilities like <i>contact me</i> (email),
        <i>submt</i> (forms and applications), or online purchases. In order for me include these advanced functions, I
        still need to learn more about web development. Web page interactve capabilities are developed through
        programing languages called Javascript and PHP, which I am in the process of learning. My plan is to modernize
        it after I learn more.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></div>
        I first learned website design in the 90's, but didn't persue it. Since then, the industry has made huge
        advancements. This was my first step in relearning. I learn by doing. Hope my momentum continues and I can learn
        more.</p>
