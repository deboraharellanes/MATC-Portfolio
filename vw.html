        <div><strong>Context,&nbsp;Audience, and Purpose</strong></div>
        Some time ago, I don’t know when, my dad bought a 1970 Beetle. It changed hands a few times, till it was passed
        down to me. By then it needed a lot of work. I found a small VW repair shop—and little did I know, I was walking
        into the hub of a community of Vintage VW connoisseurs and collectors. I became friends with the owners and
        within a few years found myself immersed.<p><p>My idea for the website started as a tribute to all the great
        people that keep old VW’s running. It evolved into a beginner’s repair guide. My audience is mechanics who
        already know how to work on cars but need specifics about VW’s or beginning mechanics who need to learn the basics.
         </p>
         <p>
        <div><strong>Design Process</strong></div>
        I collaborated with a VW mechanic who works out of his garage. All the car parts in the photos belong to him,
        and the demonstration photos are him removing an engine, then disassembling, and then installing it. He explained
        to me how a 4-stroke engine works, as well as all the other processes.</p>
        
        <p>I chose an overlay of a black navigation bar against a white backdrop and accented with black text. The white
        background contrasts well against the black. This two-tone color scheme creates a distraction-free environment
        and makes the information easily accessible to the user. I experimented with more color but it looked amateur.
        The straightforwardness of the distraction-free color scheme raises its credibility because of its ease of use.
        I used Helvetica sanserif throughout the text to align with ease of usability. The typeface Architect's Daughter
        is used in the navigation bar for variation and style. I used a combination of real-life photos and illustrated
        graphics to increase the credibility and value of the information.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Strengths</strong></div>A user can easily find information and it has an abundance of relevent
        graphics. The navigation bar is in large Helvetica print for easy use and readability. I coded the website in
        HTML, instead of using preformatted drag and drop software. It takes longer this way but gives me more freedom
        in making design and formatting choices. I am taking classes to learn them better.
        </p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Weakness</strong></div>
        My VW website is a 1990's level of sophistication. Even though I incorporated user experience and design concepts
        to the best of my ability, it still doesn't have any interactive capabilities like <i>contact me</i> (email),
        <i>submit</i> (forms and applications), or online purchases. I still need to learn more about web development.
        Web page interactive capabilities are developed through programing languages called Javascript and PHP, which
        I am in the process of learning. I plan to modernize it after I learn more.</p>

        <p>
        <div><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></div>
        I first learned about coding websites in the 1990s but didn't pursue it. Since then, the computer science industry has
        advanced. I learn by doing and this was my first step in relearning. I had to review HTML and learn CSS in addition to
        learning how to set up a repository for a webhost so that I didn't have to buy a .com or carry a flash drive. I looked
        at JavaScript and realized it wasn't something that could be learned quickly, so I wasn't able to build in any interactive 
        functions. That is my next endeavor.
